# Keyword Research Reference

## Research Process

### Step 1: Seed Keywords
- Core gameplay mechanics (puzzle, match, tap, swipe)
- Game genre (arcade, casual, strategy)
- Theme/aesthetic (space, medieval, cartoon)
- Player emotions (relaxing, challenging, addictive)

### Step 2: Competitor Analysis
1. Find top 10 games in your category
2. Note their titles, subtitles
3. Use App Store search suggestions
4. Check what keywords autocomplete

### Step 3: Keyword Scoring

| Factor | Weight | How to Assess |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Relevance | 40% | Does it describe your game? |
| Search Volume | 30% | Does autocomplete show it? |
| Competition | 20% | How many results? |
| Conversion | 10% | Will searchers want your game? |

### Step 4: Keyword Field Optimization

100 characters, use wisely:

```
# GOOD (no spaces after commas, no duplicates from title)
puzzle,brain,logic,thinking,mind,challenging,addictive,offline,free

# BAD (wasted space, duplicates)
puzzle game, brain games, puzzle, logic game
```

## Keyword Categories

### High Value (include if relevant)
- "offline" (strong conversion)
- "free" (if applicable)
- "no wifi" (synonym coverage)
- "relaxing" or "challenging" (emotional)

### Low Value (avoid)
- Category names ("games", "apps")
- Common words ("the", "and", "for")
- Competitor brand names (rejection risk)
- Plural forms (Apple auto-pluralizes)

## Localization Strategy

| Market | Priority Keywords |
|--------|-------------------|
| US | Primary market, optimize first |
| UK | Separate from US, different terms |
| Germany | Requires translation + local keywords |
| Japan | Requires native speaker review |
| China | Not applicable (separate App Store) |

## Measurement

After 2-4 weeks, check:
- Impressions (visibility)
- Product page views (click-through)
- Downloads (conversion)

Adjust keywords with low impressions but high relevance.
